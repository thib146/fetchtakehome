# Fetch Take Home Project

Here is my submission of the Fetch take home test.

Data is retrieved from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json and displayed in a list, grouped by listId (each listId grouping has a different background color) and ordered by name.

# Features

* MVVM architecture
* Dependency injections using Hilt
* Network handling with Retrofit
* Data storage using Room so that the app is usable offline after lauching it once
* UI and navigation with Jetpack Compose
* Pull-to-refresh feature on the Home screen'

  Thank you for reviewing
